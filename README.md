# Matrix Multiplication

Cloud and Edge Computing Programming Assignment 1

## Description

Multiply the three matrices: A, B, and C;  i.e., you are expected to find the matrix D where D=(A*B)*C. 
A, B, and, C contain random numbers in the range of (0,1) and the dimensions of the matrices are as follows.
<br>A is a matrix with dimension 10<sup>6</sup> x 10<sup>3</sup>
<br>B is a matrix with dimension 10<sup>3</sup> x 10<sup>6</sup>
<br>C is a matrix with dimension 10<sup>6</sup> x 1

Provide a report (PDF) that contains the following sections (section headings in bold text).
1. **Availability**. A URL for the source code where your code is available. Please ensure that the code is documented.(0.5 point)  
2. **Programming Language**. Details on the choice of programming language you used, and the libraries. (0.5 point) 
3. **Methodology**.  Details of how the matrix are created and multiplied, and the techniques for evaluating the performance. (2 points).
4. **Dataset**. Plot a (empirical) cumulative distribution function (CDF) of all the values present in matrix A. What can you infer from the CDF? (2 points)
5. **Evaluation**. Plot the time evolution of the memory usage, and CPU (and/or GPU) usage of your solution. What do you infer from the plots? (2 points)
6. **Discussion**. Detail the various challenges encountered and how you addressed those challenges. If you are unable to obtain D, what is the largest size of the matrices for which you were able to compute D.  (3 points)
